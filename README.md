# Named-Entity-Recognition-Comparison-Project
The objective of this project is to compare two different approaches to Named Entity Recognition (NER): SpaCy's machine learning-based approach and NLTK's rule-based approach. Named Entity Recognition is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying proper nouns in text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, and more. By evaluating the performance and results of these two popular libraries, we aim to highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach in extracting meaningful entities from contemporary news articles.
